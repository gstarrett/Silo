Suite of tools for rapid searching of SRA for reads of interest with the ultimate goal of novel organism discovery and genome completion.

Steps:

1) Thresher: Rapidly search SRA datasets using either nucleotide or protein based queries and capture hits.

2) Winnow: Convert thresher output to fasta for additional filtering/assembly.

3) Mill: Extend assembled contigs using overhanging exact match reads.
